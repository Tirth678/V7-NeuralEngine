<h1>This is end-to-end Price Prediction Model</h1>
The project is focused on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a house price prediction system.
<br>
The pipeline is developed using ZenML, a MLOps framework that helps in managing machine learning workflows, and MLflow, which is used for experiment tracking and model deployment.
<br>
The primary goal is to predict house prices based on various features of the properties, such as the size, location, and condition.
